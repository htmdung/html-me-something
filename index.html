            <h2>I miss Vietnam</h2>   
                <p>
                    I left Vietnam about 10 years ago, and I went back to visit Vietnam in 2014. After that, I didn't have a chance to go back to Vietnam again, and I am missing Vietnam a lot, so I would like to introduce you about Vietnam country. 
                </p>     
                <p>
                    Vietnam has been long known as one of the go-to destinations with a coastline of 3260 km, honey-combed long stretching sandlines, and a wide range of food and activity choices. From North to South, it is filled with sun-kissed beaches remarked by their own signatures, which is a quintessential part of what makes this country such a tropical paradise.

                <h4> Mekong Delta </h4>
                <p>
                    Comprised of dense green rice paddies and lazy, winding rivers, the Mekong Delta is like no other region in Vietnam. Whether firmly on land or floating with the river current, this region is flush with wildlife, historical sights, and incredible landscapes. The River of Nine Dragons, as locals know the area, is where the Mekong splinters into nine separate branches, crisscrossing low landscapes before reaching the sea. Life moves much more slowly here and is often surrounded by water. You'll find even homes, farms, and markets take on an aquatic adaptation in the Mekong Delta.

                <h4> Hue </h4>
                <p>
                    Huế is a city chock-full of stories. The Kings of the Nguyen Dynasty built their feudal capital along Huế’s fertile riverbanks and atop its forested hills, but their imperial legacy is just one of many reasons to visit. Huế’s refined cuisine is the stuff of legend, and its leafy streets are lined with mossy pagodas, art déco mansions, and eye-popping markets. Through the whole scene flows the Perfume River, setting a languid pace the rest of the city is happy to follow.

                <h4> Sapa </h4>
                <p>
                    Sapa town stands at the head of a deep valley of magnificent rice terraces that are still worked today as they have been for centuries. Backdrops don’t get much more spectacular. Enticing ribbons of road lead the eye down to the valley floor, white-water rivers rush among rice fields, and lush green mountains stretch into the distance as far as the eye can see. The highest peak in the region, Mount Fansipan, crowns the ragged ridge line high above town.

                <h4> Phở </h4>
                <p>
                    Phở is the quintessential Vietnamese dish, the word phở referring to the type of noodle used in the recipe. Flat rice noodles dance around with medium-rare slivers of beef or boiled chicken in a hearty beef stock. 
                    The more popular of the two widely known varieties is phở Hanoi. Originally from the north, it is distinguished by a clear broth and dressed only with a squeeze of lemon and slices of bird’s eye chili. The southern iteration, phở Nam, has a murkier broth and is served with a bouquet of fresh herbs like bean sprouts, basil and mint. The secret to a good bowl of phở lies in its stock. The broth is usually infused with fragrant star anise, clove and cinnamon to lend a natural sweetness to the mix. This dish is found on almost every street corner and is actually consumed for breakfast, unbeknownst to outsiders.

                <h4> Cơm Tấm </h4>
                <p>
                    Back in the day, Vietnamese farmers would eat the fractured rice grains they could not sell. Nowadays, “broken” rice is a food staple for the everyday working-class citizen. For a meal of humble origins, the preparations for cơm tấm can get very decadent.
                    While it's prepared in a number of ways, the most popular is cơm tấm sườn nướng ốp la. A fried egg is paired with caramelised grilled pork chop and laid out on a generous heap of broken rice. The dish is then slathered with nước chấm, a mixture of chilli, fish sauce and sugar, and a drizzle of green onion oil. The final touches include a side of shredded pickled carrots and daikon, slices of cucumbers and tomatoes, and crushed fried pork rinds and shallots for garnish.

                <h4> Bánh Mì </h4>
                <p>
                    Baguettes may have been adopted from the French, but bánh mì is as Vietnamese as it comes. Paté and margarine are spread swiftly across the soft, chewy interior of a baguette and later, the sandwich is loaded with pickled vegetables, fresh cilantro, pork belly, pork floss and cucumber. Sink your teeth into the crunchy crust and watch the warm roll give way to a whole scheme of textures.
